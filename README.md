# DAOstack Collaboration
This is a public repository to help coordinate collaboration efforts with teams working in the DAOstack ecosystem. The aim is to maintain a participatory roadmap that shows where the stack is headed, what needs to be done and who is doing what. This is also a forum place where teams can get on-boarded, connect with one another and share updates.

# How to Use this Repo
This repo facilitates collaboration via issue and proposal tracking. Essentially, the problems and ideas which we believe to be important will appear on the Issues tab. Projects that were funded through proposals will appear in the proposals folder.

- [**Issues**](https://github.com/dOrgTech/DAOstack-collab/issues): Find projects to work on or suggest projects for others. 
- [**Proposals**](https://github.com/dOrgTech/DAOstack-collab/tree/master/proposals): See passed proposals or add your own.
- [**Roadmap**](https://github.com/dOrgTech/DAOstack-collab/wiki): Learn about the broader direction the stack.

## Adding a Proposal

All funding proposals must be submitted directly to the [Genesis DAO](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x294f999356ed03347c7a23bcbcf8d33fa41dc830). This repo is only intended to add convenience and reduce information asymmetries for builders in the DAOstack ecosystem.

We recommend that you add your proposal details to this repo via Pull Request, then link to the PR in your proposal. See a [template](https://github.com/dOrgTech/DAOstack-collab/blob/master/proposals/_template.md) here and an example proposal [here](TODO).

If Genesis passes the proposal, then the PR will be merged. Over time, you can also add delivery materials and updates to the same document. This makes it easy to report back to the community on your progress.
